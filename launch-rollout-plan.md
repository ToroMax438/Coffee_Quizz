## Channel Strategy

**Placement:**
- Home screen card (native feel)
- Post-purchase prompt (high intent moment)

**Copy:**
- Headline: "What's your coffee personality?"
- Subtext: "60 seconds. 6 questions. Your perfect cup."
- CTA: "Find Out"

**Targeting:**

| Segment | Show Banner? |
|---------|--------------|
| New members (< 7 days) | Yes - part of onboarding |
| Active, no quiz | Yes - primary target |
| Completed quiz | No - show "View My Type" instead |
| Dormant (30+ days inactive) | Yes - re-engagement hook |

**Frequency:**
- First 7 days: Show on every app open until completed
- After 7 days: Show once per session, max 3x/week
- After completion: Replace with "Your type: [Type]" badge

**Metrics:**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Banner tap rate | 15%+ |
| Quiz start rate (after tap) | 90%+ |
| Quiz completion rate | 80%+ |

### 2. Barista Mentions (Secondary Channel)

Standard (during slower moments):
> "Hey, we just launched this thing to help you find your signature drink - takes like a minute on your phone. Wanna try it?"

For regulars:
> "You know how we always talk about what you should try next? We made a quiz for that. I'm curious what you'd get."

If they seem interested:
> "Just open the app - it's right on the home screen."

**When to Mention:**

| Situation | Mention? |
|-----------|----------|
| Rush (3+ drinks deep) | No |
| Regulars | Yes |
| Lingerers (staying to work/chat) | Yes |

- 1-page cheat sheet (6 types + signature drinks)

## Failure Criteria (30-Day Checkpoint)

### Red Flags - Pause and Reassess

| Metric | Failure Threshold | Action |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Quiz completion rate | < 60% | UX problem - investigate drop-off points |
| Post-quiz 7-day purchase rate | < 20% | Not driving behavior - quiz is entertainment only |
| 30-day retention (quiz takers) | < 30% | Quiz isn't creating stickiness |
| Type distribution imbalance | Any type > 50% or < 5% | Quiz logic is broken |

### Yellow Flags - Iterate

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Action |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Quiz completion rate | 60-70% | Review question 3-4 drop-off |
| Post-quiz 7-day purchase rate | 20-30% | Test drink rec prominence |
| Share rate | < 5% | Results not compelling enough |

### Green Light - Scale

| Metric | Success Threshold |
|--------|-------------------|
| Quiz completion rate | ≥ 80% |
| Post-quiz 7-day purchase rate | ≥ 35% |
| 30-day retention (quiz takers) | ≥ 40% |
| Type validation match rate | ≥ 70% |

### Kill Criteria

**Pull the plug entirely if (at 30 days):**
- Completion rate < 50% AND
- Post-quiz purchase rate < 15% AND
- No improvement trend week-over-week

**This means:** The quiz isn't engaging AND isn't driving behavior AND isn't getting better. Time to try something else.
